# Paw-Printz
Our project integrates emotional self-care with an interactive and responsive virtual pet. Through daily check-ins, students log emotions, and the pet offers tailored mental health resources, encouragement, and activities. This fosters self-awareness, routine, and connection, providing a comforting tool to support student well-being.
